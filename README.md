Cassandra is a free and open-source, distributed, wide-column store, NoSQL database management system designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure.

Design for a movie ticket registration system in Cassandra:

CREATE TABLE movie_ticket_registration (
    customer_id text,
    movie_name text,
    movie_date date,
    movie_time timestamp,
    theater_location text,
    seat_number text,
    ticket_price decimal,
    PRIMARY KEY (customer_id, movie_date)
);

This table has a compound primary key consisting of the customer_id and movie_date columns. The customer_id column is used as the partition key, which will ensure that all data for a given customer is stored together. The movie_date column is used as the clustering key, which will allow you to retrieve data in sorted order based on the date of the show.


To perform insert, delete, update, and search operations on this table, you can use the following CQL commands:


Insert: To insert a new movie ticket registration for a customer, you can use the INSERT command as follows:

      INSERT INTO movie_ticket_registration (customer_id, movie_name, movie_date, movie_time, theatre_location, seat_number, ticket_price)

Delete: To delete a movie ticket registration for a customer, you can use the DELETE command as follows:
 
      DELETE FROM movie_ticket_registration WHERE customer_id = '1234' AND movie_date = '2023-04-15';

Update: To update the seat number for a movie ticket registration for a customer, you can use the UPDATE command as follows:

      UPDATE movie_ticket_registration SET seat_number = 'A4' WHERE customer_id = '1234' AND movie_date = '2023-04-15';

Search: To search for all the movie ticket registrations for a customer, you can use the SELECT command as follows:

      SELECT * FROM movie_ticket_registration WHERE customer_id = '1234' AND movie_date = '2023-04-15';
